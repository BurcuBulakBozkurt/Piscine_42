# About 42 and Piscine
42 is a private, nonprofit and tuition-free computer programming school that proposes a new way of learning: no teachers, students learning one from others (peer to peer learning).
The Piscine (from the French word for "swimming pool") is the last phase before full admission to the 42 Berlin program. It's 4 weeks long, designed to learn the basics of programming. 
Piscine was very intensive perood and in my experience, it is very difficult to manage when you have a job. The time is very limited and you have to be at school day and night to pass. 

During the initial two days of Piscine; participants focus on acquiring knowledge about basic to intermediate shell commands. This helps them become proficient in navigating through the terminal smoothly. However, in general, the main programming language taught is C. This includes various concepts such as variables, pointers, memory allocation, macros, and the creation of functions and programs. Students also learn about using and creating libraries and Makefiles.
